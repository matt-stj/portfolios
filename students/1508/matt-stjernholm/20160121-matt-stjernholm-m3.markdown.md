# Matt Stjernholm - M3 Portfolio

### Your Mission

My main goal for this module was to gain the knowledge/confidence to feel like a real developer.

### Attendance

In this module, I missed one Friday and was tardy two days.

### Work

Below are the projects that I completed for module 3.

## Individual

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/matt-stj/api-twitter-curious)
* [Production App](https://twitter-curious.herokuapp.com/)

  Built a Twitter look-a-like app using Omni-auth, Bootstrap, and the Twitter API.

  Scores:

  Instructor: Josh
    * Completion: 3+
    * Test-driven-development: 4
    * Code-quality: 3+
    * Organization: 4
    * UX: 4


  Notes:

  Unfollow user extension and added unfavorite tweet. Really solid project. One improvement would be to use POROs to wrap the objects returned from Twitter.


#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/matt-stj/rales_engine)

  Built Rails Engine with RESTful routes and most queries were made with Active Record.

  Scores:

  Instructor: Tess

    * Completion: 3
    * Test-driven-development: 4
    * Code-quality: 3
    * Api-design: 3.5
    * Queries: 3.5



#### Personal Project: Snow Alert App

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/matt-stj/snow_alert)
  * [Heroku](https://snow-a1ert.herokuapp.com)
  * [Digital Ocean](http://104.236.171.87)

  Built an app where users can select their favorite ski resorts to get email updates on when they can
  expect to have a powder day.  Hit Forecast.io and Google maps API's, learned Semantic UI front-end for
  this project, and used caching to increase performance.

    Scores: TBD

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* For Shannon Paige -   
*I really enjoyed working with Shannon on the Pivot and also collaborating with her on Rails Engine. She brings a great problem-solving ability to any coding challenge and I'm grateful for everything that I learned from her in Module 3.*  

* For Mike Wong -   
*Mike was very helpful both as a teammate on the Pivot and also as a resource for advice throughout Module 3. He's always looking to lend a hand and did a great job helping out with his prior knowledge of the curriculum*

* For Cole Hall -   
*Happy to have had the chance to work with Cole on the Pivot.  At the beginning of the project we had the chance to pair a couple times, and I felt like it was easy for us to stay on the same page.*

### Being a Community Member


### Playing a Part  

At my last portfolio review, Rachel asked me to "Try to kick up the level a bit. Go above and beyond and bring your peers along with you."  Honestly, I feel like I fell short of this during Module 3 and will look to put in more during the next module. I am happy, however, with the life-balance that I was able to achieve during strenuous workload of Module 3.
